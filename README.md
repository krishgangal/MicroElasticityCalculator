# MicroElasticityCalculator

Microeconomics Elasticity Calculator with Inputs
Calculating elasticity in micro is so teedious, especially when your teacher assigns a lot.
I decided to make my own calculator with some code!

The "Calculator in Java" is an old version I made in Java. 
It kinda sucks and throws errors. Also it's really ugly. 
Don't use this one please >:(

The "new_python_version" is a lot cooler and more complete. 
It has custom exceptions, helper functions, the whole shebang. 
I would highly recommend using this one, and I hope it helps make your life easier!
