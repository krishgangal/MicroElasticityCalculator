# Uses

This is a microeconomics elasticity calculator that takes in four inputs
It takes in two original prices and two new prices.
Calculating elasticity in micro is so tedious, especially when your teacher assigns a lot.
There is a lot of calculator button mashing, so I wanted to avoid that.
I decided to make my own calculator with some code!

# Old Calculator
The "Calculator in Java" is an old version I made in Java. 
It sucks and throws errors if the inputs don't work. Also it's really ugly. 
Please don't use this one. 
I just included it because it's what I made back when I did micro.

# New Calculator
The "new_python_version" is a lot cooler and more complete. 
It has custom exceptions, helper functions, the whole shebang. 
I would highly recommend using this one, and I hope it helps make your life easier!
